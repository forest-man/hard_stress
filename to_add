SH:
1. System live monitoring (applied for disc eat, and for mem eat, for cpu eat) (done)
2. End subscript without kill the main script (while dame) and automatically delete eat/ directory when script is stopped (done)
3. Add easy way to exit cpu consumption script and main hard_stress script (done)
4. Add comments in every script (done)
5. Add Multitreading CPU consumption test (done, but make a live stats)
---just test---
PY:


WARN: when CPU consumption is 99.9% and higher, the machine is down!!!!!
6. Main - Merge into one script - Implement mode selection via cli keys(-m memory, -c cpu) (done)
7. Implement pseudo dame file as a function in main py script (add deleting mechanism of spaceeating file after sigkill) (done)
9. Change multiprocessing by shared libraries https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6832554/multiprocessing-how-do-i-share-a-dict-among-multiple-processes (done)
10. Make script stopping mechanism while CPU and mem_eat is on it's way to prevent whole machine freeze - via echo server using telnet (done)
11. Make nice message after remote CPU cons (4 threads) and memory cons stopping
12. Remotely stop mem cons after MemoryError exception was caught (done)
13. Make mem cons to run unlimited time, up to remote kill - maybe daemons will be help
14. Output to user ip address of echo server
15. Make the timestamps (done)
16. Make disc cinsumption via trhreads
####################################
17. Kill main script after mem_cons was remotely killed - to speed up memory cleaning
18. Make another server for remote grep ps ux
